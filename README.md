# Country Two Step Tour - Points Registry

This is the web site for the CTST Points Registry project, deployed to [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages).

The site is running live at: https://ctstpoints.github.io

This project aims to provide a searchable database/web site containing CTST Points Registry data.

The up-to-date data from all CTST events are included in the database. As new CTST events are held, the Points Registry data will be updated as soon as feasible after the official contest results are received from the event organizers.

Note, this is the deployed live site, not the development repository. All development is done in the development repository, https://github.com/ctstpoints/ctst-dev. The development copy of the web site is located at `ctst-dev/generate_website/www`. Once tested, the contents of the development web site folder, `www/*` are copied to the live repository here, then pushed to GitHub. Upon pushing to GitHub, the site will automatically be deployed and should be live within minutes.

The site should run on mobile and desktop devices. Use the `Add to Home Screen` option under the Share icon at the botton of the web page in Safari on an iPhone.
