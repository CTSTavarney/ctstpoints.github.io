# Country Two Step Tour - Database Search

This is the web site for the CTST Points database search project, deployed to GitHub Pages.

The site is running live at: https://ctstpoints.github.io

This project aims to provide a searchable database/web site containing CTST Points Registry data. It can be used in the interim to access CTST points data until the new, official CTST web site/database is developed.

Currently, only data from the legacy CTST Points Registry (dated January 14, 2020) is used, which includes all CTST events up to and including the 2020 UCWDC World Championships. Hopefully, the data from all subsequent CTST contests will soon be available, at which time this data/web site will be updated.

**DISCLAIMER: All data contained herein has been obtained from publically-accessible sources, primarily data published by the Country Two Step Tour. This data is not the "official" contest result data. The respective Event Directors and their official score-keepers maintain the "official" contest results. Therefore, expect errors and omissions in the CTST data used by this project.**

Note, this is the deployed live site, not the development repository. All development is done in the development repository, https://github.com/ctstpoints/ctst-dev. The development copy of the web site is located at `ctst-dev/generate_website/www`. Once tested, the contents of the development web site folder, `www/*` are copied to the live repository here, then pushed to GitHub. Upon pushing to GitHub, the site will automatically be deployed and should be live within approximately 60 seconds.

The site should run on mobile and desktop devices. Use the `Add to Home Screen` option under the Share icon at the botton of the web page in Safari on an iPhone.
